# 🚀 Workshop – Arrays & Strings in Java

🎯 You will be building an application that **stores names** in a **String array** and implements various functionalities such as **adding, searching, updating, and removing names**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Names will be stored in a **String array** with the following format:
  ```
  ["Erik Svensson", "Mehrdad Javan"]
  ```
  Each name follows the structure: **[First Name] [Whitespace] [Last Name]**.

- You **may** add private helper methods to keep your code clean and modular. 🛠️

- 🚫 **Restrictions:**
   - ❌ **Do NOT use Collections** (List, Set, Map, etc.)
   - ❌ **Do NOT use Stream API**
   - ❌ **Do NOT change the current method signatures**
   - ✅ You can use **Arrays class** for array manipulations.

## 🏗️ Steps to Complete the Workshop

### 🔗 Step 1: Fork the Repository
You can **fork the repository** from the **link provided by your teacher**.  
This will create your own copy of the project where you can make changes.

### 🛠️ Step 2: Implement the TODO Parts
In the `NameRepository.java` file, you will find several methods with **TODO comments**.  
Your task is to **implement** these methods to ensure the program works as expected.

### 🛠️ Step 3: (Optional) Test Implemented Methods
Once you have implemented the methods in `NameRepository.java`, you can **test them** in the  `NameRepositoryTest.java` to ensure they work correctly.
