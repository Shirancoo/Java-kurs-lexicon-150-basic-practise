# Java Stream API Workshop 🌊

Welcome to the Stream API Practice Workshop! This hands-on exercise will help you master Java Streams through practical examples.

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Fork & Clone**
    - Fork this repository to your GitHub account 🍴
    - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

2. **Project Location** 📂
    - Navigate to: `src/test/java/se/lexicon/vxo/service`
    - Open the `StreamExercise.java` file

## 🎓 Workshop Overview

This workshop contains 14 exercises that will help you practice:
- Stream operations
- Lambda expressions
- Collection transformations
- Data filtering and mapping
- Advanced stream operations

## 📝 Requirements

- All solutions must use Java Stream API
- Use lambda expressions (no anonymous inner classes)
- Each task has unit tests that must pass
- Follow the TODO comments in the code

## 🚀 How to Complete

1. Open `StreamExercise.java`
2. Look for the `// todo: write your code here` comments
3. Implement your solution using Streams
4. Run the tests to verify your solution
5. Move to the next task when tests pass

## 💡 Tips

- Read the test assertions to understand expected outcomes
- Use the Java Stream API documentation when needed
- Pay attention to the method comments for requirements
- Start with simpler tasks (like task2) before moving to complex ones
- Don't **DO NOT MODIFY:** existing methods or class structure.
- Keep your code clean and organized

Happy Coding! 💻
